Type Sharing Rules

- OpenAPI schema is the single source of truth.
- Never manually define API response interfaces in frontend.
- Always import types from @turbo-notes/types.
- If backend schema changes, regenerate types.
- Do not modify generated types manually.
- Use type inference from generated OpenAPI paths.
