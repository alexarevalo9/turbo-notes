You are working inside a Turborepo monorepo.

Stack:

- Backend: Django 5 + DRF + SimpleJWT + drf-spectacular
- Frontend: Next.js 16 App Router + TypeScript
- Auth: httpOnly cookies only
- Data fetching: Server Components first, native fetch
- No localStorage for auth
- OpenAPI types are source of truth

Rules:

- Prefer Server Components over Client Components.
- Never access localStorage for authentication.
- Authentication tokens must be read from httpOnly cookies using next/headers.
- All API calls must go through a centralized server API helper.
- Never duplicate API response types manually.
- Types must come from @turbo-notes/types.
- Follow clean architecture and separation of concerns.
- No business logic inside React components.
- Avoid unnecessary client-side state.
